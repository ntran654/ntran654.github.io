    <p>You are a wanted criminal who just stole some cash! Jump over obstacles in your way to escape because your life depends on it! Watch out though. These cars can come at you fast.</p>

    <h4>Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.</h4>
    <p>In preparation to make the Scratch game, I learned about variables, algorithms, and other concepts like event-handling and parallel execution. 
    We used a "distance" variable to measure the distance the character runs. 
    Algorithms were used in the moving car and the scripts that controled the movement of the character.
    In event-handling, we created a responsive game that can jump from the homescreen to the gameplay based on the buttons the player clicks.
    Lots of parallel execution was done because the sprites needed to execute different tasks like appearing randomly or to move a certain distance.</p>
    
    <h4>Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve or overcome them?</h4>
    <p>We encountered a lot of problems making the game. We struggled with the movement of cars with consideration to the jumping speed. 
    The "game over" mechanism was a bit difficult; we had a hard time making sure the coins disappeared when the character touches the car sprite.</p>

    <h4>What aspects of your game do you like best?</h4>
    <p>I do enjoy the concept of the game and the amount of work put into making it as appealing as possible to the player.</p>

    <h4>If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?</h4>
    <p>We would definitely refine the jumping mechanism and the moving objects so that it is more enjoyable for the player. </p>
