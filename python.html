    You are an employee at this company that goes into the memories of patients on their deathbeds to grant their life's wishes. Xavier has requested to have his wishes granted: to live a life without regrets. You are tasked with changing some of his memories to grant his wish. How much will you change?

    <h4>Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your story.</h4>
    <p>We utlized while loops to run our error message in case the player inputs an incorrect string that the game does not recognize. We also stacked if statements to make our story interactive and proceed to different scenarios, according to the player's input.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>Think back to other stories you read, identify one or two stories you particularly like? Why?</h4>
    <p>I enjoyed the story of losing morality by Ben and the Sanic game! They had interesting plot lines, great characterization, and multiple scenarios that had some thought behind it. I enjoyed reading them, and they kept me engaged.</p>
